# Weather Data SQL Analysis

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates structured data analysis using SQL on a weather dataset containing temperature, humidity, and weather condition records for multiple South African cities. The goal is to extract meaningful insights through aggregation, filtering, and trend analysis.

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains:

- **City** – name of the city  
- **Temperature (°C)** – recorded daily temperature  
- **Humidity (%)** – daily humidity level  
- **Condition** – weather condition (Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy)  
- **Date** – date of the record

## Key SQL Concepts Demonstrated

- SELECT statements  
- WHERE filtering  
- GROUP BY aggregation  
- ORDER BY sorting  
- COUNT(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()  
- LIMIT clause

## Analysis Queries

1. **Average temperature per city** – shows average temperature for each city.  
2. **Weather condition frequency** – counts how many times each condition occurs.  
3. **High humidity records (>65%)** – lists cities and dates with high humidity.  
4. **Hottest recorded day** – identifies the city and date with the highest temperature.  
5. **Temperature statistics per city** – provides total records, average, minimum, and maximum temperatures per city.
